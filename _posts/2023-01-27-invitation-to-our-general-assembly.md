Hei hei!

We, the Blindern Student Garden Association, invite all our members and those who are interested to our general assembly!

We will kick off the meeting with out first planting activity this year: preseeding tomatoes! We'll also gather around a cup of coffee and talk about project ideas for 2023 and elect a new board.

Everyone is welcome, it's a great opportunity to get to know the garden!
