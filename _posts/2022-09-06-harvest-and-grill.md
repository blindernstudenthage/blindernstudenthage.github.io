Hei hagefolks!

Join us on **Sunday, 11th of September, 13.00** for the beginning of harvesting season! We'll see what we can already harvest and make some food on the grill. We're providing some basic food and coal, but feel free to bring anything you'd like to eat yourself. We especially welcome all interested students that would like to get to know the garden :)
