Hei hagefolks and friends!

As the summer break is approaching, we're in need for some helping hands to water the plants, every now and then ðŸŒ± If you'd like to help us out (even just for an hour!), join us on Sunday at 13.00! We'll show you around in our beautiful garden, and tell you where the secret water tap is ðŸ’§

See you ðŸ™‚
